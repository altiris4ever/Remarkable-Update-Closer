Similarities:
Core Functionality: Both scripts aim to identify and close dialog windows with a specific partial title (PartialTitle) belonging to a specific process (ProcessName).

Windows API Integration: Both scripts import the User32 class for access to Windows API functions like EnumWindows, GetWindowText, PostMessage, and GetWindowThreadProcessId.

Window Handling Logic: The callback functions in both scripts iterate through all open windows, match titles, and send the WM_CLOSE message if the title and process match.

Differences:
Pros: Reduces CPU usage by increasing wait time when no matching windows are found.
Cons: Might delay response when a window appears after a long wait.
Process-Driven Monitoring (concept Script):

Pros: Eliminates unnecessary window enumeration when the process isn't running. Efficient when the target process starts/stops frequently.
Cons: Relies on the target process being active to perform any action.
Logging (concept Script):

Pros: Provides a detailed log for debugging and record-keeping.
Cons: Increases disk I/O slightly, but the impact is minimal.
Error Handling (concept Script):

Pros: Robust handling of exceptions, ensuring the script exits cleanly.
Cons: Slightly more complex, requiring understanding of try-catch-finally.


Both script could be compiled into .EXE format for easy and silent running:
How to Create a Compiled .exe from PowerShell
You can use tools like PS2EXE to compile a PowerShell script into a .exe file.

Steps to Compile:
Install PS2EXE:
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell command:
Install-Module -Name PS2EXE -Scope CurrentUser

Compile the Script:
Assuming your script is named MonitorRemarkable.ps1, run the following command to create a .exe:
powershell command:
Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile "MonitorRemarkable.ps1" -OutputFile "MonitorRemarkable.exe"
Run the Compiled .exe:
The resulting .exe file will run directly without requiring the PowerShell interpreter.
If you use: Invoke-ps2exe .\StartCW.ps1 -noConsole -iconFile C:\Temp\Ikon.ico the script will have no black windows.
